# GOALS TO START WITH

- Finish out the basic functionality of the ord client server
- Make server components modular so that they can be used as web services
- Make client be builder and artist focused first. Roll in functionality of OPM Ord Package Manager https://github.com/cypherpunklab/opm
- Make a easy to use UI for artist and developers to test out inscriptions like in OPM without having to use the command line.
- Make light client breakout parts to have minimal versions of bord where sat index is not needed.

# GOALS TO EXPLORE

- Look at implementing ordinal theory. see ordinals.ts can start off using the current ord index.
